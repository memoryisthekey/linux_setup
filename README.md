# Next features:
* Add flag to install ros-melodic or ros2-humble (Maybe make it so ros2 is also reconfigurable so we are not stuck to humble, and can choose which ever)
* Add --help to display options
* Add a way to either check the names of the wallpapers and select one or show the wallpapers (might need 3rd party sw)
* Add options for robotics toolbox python, and spatial maths all under one flag
